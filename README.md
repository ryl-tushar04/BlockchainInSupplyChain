## **Introduction**

This project focuses on improving supply chain management by implementing a blockchain-based system. It utilizes **Ethereum smart contracts** to create an immutable ledger for tracking products, verifying authenticity, and automating processes like payments and quality checks, ensuring trust and transparency among stakeholders.

## **Features**

- ðŸ“¦ **Product Tracking**: Records product movements from origin to consumer on the blockchain.  
- ðŸ”’ **Secure Data Access**: Restricts sensitive data to authorized parties using cryptographic controls.  
- ðŸ¤– **Smart Contract Automation**: Automates supply chain processes like payments and certifications.  
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization Dashboard**: Displays real-time transaction logs and product status timelines.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js (v16 or higher)  
- Libraries:
  - `web3.js`
  - `truffle`
  - `express` (for backend API, if applicable)
  - `react` (for frontend dashboard, if applicable)
  - `ganache-cli` (for local blockchain testing)
- MetaMask (browser extension for blockchain interaction)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ryl-tushar04/BlockchainInSupplyChain.git
    cd BlockchainInSupplyChain
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (if using Python components):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install required libraries:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Update `.env` with blockchain network details (e.g., Infura API key, wallet private key).

---

## **Usage**

### **Run the Blockchain Application**

1. **Start the local blockchain** (if using Ganache):

    ```bash
    ganache-cli
    ```

2. **Deploy smart contracts**:

    ```bash
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```

3. **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Access the dashboard**:

   Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser with MetaMask installed to interact with the blockchain.

5. **Track products**:

   Use `track_product.js` to add or update product details and query transaction history via the dashboard.

## **Dataset**

The dataset consists of sample supply chain data, including product details (e.g., ID, origin, destination) and transaction logs. You can access the sample dataset in the repository:

ðŸ”— **[Sample Dataset](https://github.com/ryl-tushar04/BlockchainInSupplyChain/tree/main/data)**

---

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**

- Collect product and transaction data from supply chain stakeholders.  
- Format data as JSON for smart contract interactions.  

### **2. Feature Engineering**

- Define product attributes (e.g., ID, timestamp, status).  
- Create transaction logs for blockchain storage.

### **3. Smart Contract Architecture**

- Solidity contracts for product tracking and access control.  
- Event-based logging for supply chain updates.

### **4. Deployment**

- Deploy contracts on a local or testnet blockchain.  
- Integrate with Web3.js for frontend/backend interaction.

## **Results**

### **System Performance**

| Metric                 | Value  |
|------------------------|--------|
| Transaction Throughput | 50 tx/s (local blockchain) |
| Latency (avg)          | 2s     |
| Data Integrity         | 100%   |
| Access Control         | 100% secure |

## **Future Enhancements**

- Integrate IoT devices for real-time product tracking (e.g., location, temperature).  
- Support multiple blockchain platforms (e.g., Hyperledger, Polygon).  
- Add predictive analytics for supply chain optimization.  
- Deploy on cloud platforms for enterprise scalability.
